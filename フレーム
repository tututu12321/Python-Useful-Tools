# Python function to print frame-related information

def print_frame_info(frames):
    # 1 frame is equivalent to 1/60 of a second (since the game runs at 60fps)
    time_in_seconds = frames / 60.0
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"{frames} frames is equal to {time_in_seconds:.3f} seconds.")

# Example usage:
# Print the time for 60 frames (1 second)
print_frame_info(60)

# Print the time for 40 frames (approx 0.667 seconds)
print_frame_info(40)
